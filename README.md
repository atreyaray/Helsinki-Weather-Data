# Predicting Helsinki's Humidity Levels using Station Weather Data and Identifying the Relationship between Humidity and other Weather Attributes

        by Atreya Ray and Long Nguyen

### Abstract

The objective of the project is to find the relative between humidity and different weather attributes using regression and linear models and ultimately identify which attributes are the strongest humidity predictors. Another goal is to classify the weather as “dry” or “not dry” based on the given measurements. We will use the KNN-algorithm to accomplish this task. One major issue which arose during the project was that the data set was high dimensional, 17 to be exact, which made the analysis complex and created more obstacles to develop a reliable classification model and increase the risk producing poor quality clusters. PCA was utilised to reduce the dimensionality of  the data by creating a new set of attributes that better captured the variability of the data. With this new attribute set, the data became less sparse in the space it occupied, and as a result, better and more accurate predictions could be achieved.
